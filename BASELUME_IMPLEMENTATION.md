# Baselume Implementation

## 🎮 Overview

This implementation transforms the Farcaster mini-app template into "baselume" - a competitive gaming platform with the following features:

### **Implemented Screens:**

1. **Login Screen** - Wallet connection and direct competition access
2. **Main Menu** - Public play vs Private rooms with recent match notifications
3. **Private Rooms Menu** - Join existing vs Create new room options
4. **Join Room** - Code input for private games
5. **Create Room** - Generate shareable links for private games
6. **Game Lobby** - Host view with participant management
7. **Game Submission** - Interactive gameplay with drawing tools

### **Key Features:**

- **Wallet Integration**: Base blockchain addresses (.base.eth)
- **Room System**: Private game rooms with codes
- **Drawing Tools**: Interactive toolbar for game submissions
- **Social Elements**: Participant tracking, match notifications
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with safe area insets

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Component Structure:**
```
src/components/
├── Demo.tsx (main container)
├── game/
│   ├── LoginScreen.tsx
│   ├── MainMenuScreen.tsx
│   ├── PrivateRoomsScreen.tsx
│   ├── JoinRoomScreen.tsx
│   ├── CreateRoomScreen.tsx
│   ├── GameLobbyScreen.tsx
│   ├── GameSubmissionScreen.tsx
│   └── DrawingToolbar.tsx
└── ui/ (existing components)
```

### **State Management:**
- `GameScreen` type for navigation
- `GameState` interface for game data
- React hooks for local state management

### **Navigation Flow:**
```
Login → Main Menu → [Private Rooms → Join/Create Room → Game Lobby] → Game Submission
                   [Play Now (direct)]
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

3. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎨 Design Implementation

### **Styling:**
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS setup
- Maintains dark/light mode support
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom button styling for game actions

### **User Experience:**
- Smooth navigation between screens
- Wallet integration with Base addresses
- Real-time participant tracking

## 🔧 Customization

### **Adding New Screens:**
1. Create component in `src/components/game/`
2. Add to `GameScreen` type
3. Add case to `renderCurrentScreen()` in `Demo.tsx`

### **Modifying Game Logic:**
- Update `GameState` interface for new data
